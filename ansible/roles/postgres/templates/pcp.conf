# File Format
# ===========
#
# List one UserID and password on a single line. They must
# be concatenated together using ':' (colon) between them.
# No spaces or tabs are allowed anywhere in the line.
#
# Example:
# postgres:e8a48653851e28c69d0506508fb27fc5
#
# Be aware that there will be no spaces or tabs at the
# beginning of the line! although the above example looks
# like so.
#
# Lines beginning with '#' (pound) are comments and will
# be ignored. Again, no spaces or tabs allowed before '#'.

# USERID:MD5PASSWD
